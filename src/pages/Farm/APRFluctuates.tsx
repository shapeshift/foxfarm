    *ShapeShift is awarding 6,750,000 FOX until November 18, 2022 to liquidity providers that stake
    their LP tokens. This is an estimated APR calculated based on the current amount of
    FOX-ETH-UNIV2 LP tokens staked in the ShapeShift rewards contract. This APR amount is subject to
    extreme volatility and this amount could drop significantly, especially in the first few weeks
    after FOX yield farming v3 starts
